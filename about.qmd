Hello! My name is Tarun and I am thrilled to present to you my project for the Illini Blockchain Research Team. This website, named 'Cognition', has been crafted by me using the R programming language. The purpose of this site is to spread awareness and educate the general public on the significance of bioinformatics. The aim of Cognition is to make bioinformatics accessible and understandable for everyone, and to highlight its importance in advancing our understanding of biological systems and processes. I hope you find this site informative and insightful, and that it inspires you to learn more about this fascinating field.

I am a sophomore in Information science and Data Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign with an interest in Bio-Informatics. I am a bioinformatics research assistant at the Carl R. Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, where I am working under Doctor Sandra Zas and Professor Bruce Southey to publish a paper on "Differential alternative splicing genes and isoform co-expression networks of Brassica napus under multiple abiotic stresses." In the position I am creating quantitative visualizations with the MISO software to make sashimi plots to find out about the "version" of a gene that are produced. I have also worked as a research assistant for the Center of Disease Control, in which I collaborated with Professor Rebecca Smith to create an Online Data Analysis Application to measure mosquito insecticide effectiveness within the United States.
